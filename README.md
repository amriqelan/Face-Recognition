# Face-Recognition

Face Recognition App
The Face Recognition App is a Python-based application that utilizes the face_recognition library and OpenCV to perform real-time face recognition on a video stream. The app allows you to capture faces, associate them with names, and recognize those faces in subsequent frames of the video.

# Notes
The captured faces are not saved permanently. They are stored in memory during the (runtime) of the application, to improve the feature and save the captured faces for future use, you can modify the code to store the face encodings and associated names in a file or a database.
